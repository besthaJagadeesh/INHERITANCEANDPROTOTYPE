    <h1> *INHERITANCE AND PROTOTYPE*</h1>
<hr>
    <div id="question"> Q1.Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object 
        using parents prototype</div>
    <div>→ 
        <pre>
            const parent ={
                firstname : "Bestha",
                lastname : "Jagadeesh",
                fullname : function title(){
                    console.log(this.firstname+" "+this.lastname);
                }
            }
            
            const child ={
                _proto_: parent
            }
            child.fullname();
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div id="Reason"> Explanation →  First an object was created and two keys were passed as firstname and lastname
        with their respected values. After that the function was called to store the parent value. And at last with the 
        help of _proto_ keyword the parent was targeted. and consoled at last.
    </div>

<div id="question">Q2.Write code to explain prototype chaining</div>
<div>
    <pre>
        let obj={
            name : "bestha"
        }
        
        let obj1 ={
            _proto_: obj,
            lastname : "Jagadeesh"
        }
        
        let obj2 = {
            _proto_: obj1,
            age :   "20",
        }
        
        console.log(obj.name)
        
    </pre>
</div>
 <div id="Reason">  Explanation → Here three objects were made by using object literal method, and 
    chaining was made by using proto keyword, and last obj was called which was obtained through chaining.

 <div id="question">Q3.Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate sum for multiple arrays</div>
<div>
    <pre>
        Array.prototype.sum = function() {
            let result = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {
              result += this[i];
            }
            return result;
          };
        
        let N1 = [6, 8, 9];
        let N2 = [7, 8, 6];
        
        
        let addition = N1.sum() + N2.sum()
        console.log(addition);
        
    </pre>
</div>
 <div id="Reason">  Explanation → Array.prototype targets the parent element where we have assigned the sum function and 
    stored it as a object, where we have made a for loop to intiate a sum function. Later on we the help of array 
    we stored values to be summed and the result is stored in the addition variable,where the output is consoled
    with the addition variable.

 <div id="question">Q4.Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.</div>
<div>
    <pre>
        class student {
            constructor(name, rollno, division){
                this.name= name;
                this.rollno= rollno;
                this.division = division; 
            }
        
            set setFriend(friend){
                this.friend= friend
            }
        }
        
        let obj = new student("Jagadeesh", "50","A")
        obj.friend="Rakesh"
        console.log(obj)
        
        class senior extends student{
             constructor(){
                super("Ramesh", "45", "B")
             }
        }
         let seniorobj = new senior();
         console.log(seniorobj)
    </pre>
</div>
 <div id="Reason">  Explanation → At first we created a class using object constructor function and respected
    parameters were passed and After that it was consoled, to retrieve the other name a new class was created
    with the help of extends keyword, and now to retrieve or recaccess the first constructor, the super function 
    was used.
